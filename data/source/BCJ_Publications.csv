METHODS: We evaluated sex differences in the prevalence of masked hypertension and the difference between awake, or alternatively 24-h, ambulatory BP and clinic BP using multivariable adjusted models among 658 participants who underwent 24-h ABPM and had clinic SBP/DBP less than 140/90 mmHg during the Year 30 Exam of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study. RESULTS: The mean age ± standard deviation (SD) of the participants was 54.8 ± 3.7 years, 58.4% were women, and 58.2% were black. The prevalence of any masked hypertension was 37.5% among women and 60.6% among men. In a model including adjustment for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, antihypertensive medication, and clinic BP, the prevalence ratios (95% confidence intervals) comparing men versus women were 1.39 (1.18-1.63) for any masked hypertension, and 1.60 (1.28-1.99), 1.71 (1.36-2.15), and 1.40 (1.13-1.73) for masked awake, 24-h and asleep hypertension, respectively. In a fully adjusted model, the differences between mean awake ambulatory BP and clinic BP were 2.75 [standard error (SE) 0.92] mmHg higher for SBP and 3.61 (SE 0.58) mmHg higher for DBP among men compared with women.

The linear mixed model, sometimes referred to as the multi-level model, is one of the most widely used tools for analyses involving clustered data. Various definitions of R 2 have been proposed for the linear mixed model, but several limitations prevail. Presently, there is no method to compute R 2 for the linear mixed model that accommodates an interpretation based on variance partitioning, a method to quantify uncertainty and produce confidence limits for the R 2 statistic, and a capacity to use the R 2 statistic to conduct covariance model selection in a manner similar to information criteria. In this article, we introduce such an R 2 statistic. The proposed R 2 measures the proportion of generalized variance explained by fixed effects in the linear mixed model.

"2068491","Journal article (Peer Reviewed)","01/04/2018",,"© 2017 The Authors BJU International © 2017 BJU International Published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd Objectives: To identify changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after diagnosis of bladder cancer in older adults in comparison with a group of adults without bladder cancer (controls). Patients and Methods: Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results registries were linked with Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (MHOS) data. Medicare beneficiaries aged ≥65 years in the period 1998–2013, who were diagnosed with bladder cancer between baseline and follow-up through the MHOS, were matched with control subjects without cancer using propensity scores. Linear mixed models were used to estimate predictors of HRQoL changes. Results: After matching, 535 patients with bladder cancer (458 non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer [NMIBC] and 77 with muscle-invasive bladder cancer [MIBC]) and 2 770 control subjects without cancer were identified. Both patients with NMIBC and those with MIBC reported significant declines in HRQoL scores over time vs controls: physical component summary −2 and −5.3 vs −0.4, respectively; bodily pain −1.9 and −3.6 vs −0.7; role physical −2.7 and −4.7 vs −0.7; general health −2.4 and −6.1 vs 0; vitality −1.2 and −3.5 vs −0.1; and social functioning −2.1 and −5.7 vs −0.8. All scores ranged from 0 to 100. When stratified by time since diagnosis, HRQoL improved over 1 year for some domains (role physical), but remained lower across most domains.

Purpose: Previous studies provided evidence for the validity of the PROMIS Pediatric measures in cross-sectional studies. This study evaluated the ability of the PROMIS Pediatric measures to detect change over time in children and adolescents with cancer, nephrotic syndrome (NS), or sickle cell disease (SCD). Methods: Participants (8–17 years) completed measures of fatigue, pain interference, anger, anxiety, depressive symptoms, mobility, upper extremity, and peer relationships at three or four time points (T1–T4). Between T1 and T2, children with cancer received chemotherapy and children with SCD experienced a pain exacerbation. Children with NS were first assessed during active disease (T2), with T3 and T4 conducted at disease remission. For the primary analysis of responsiveness, we expected better scores at T3 (recovery) compared to T2 (event) for all diseases. T1 and T4 are also expected to have better scores than T2. Linear mixed models were used and adjusted for time, gender, age, race/ethnicity, education, comorbid conditions, and disease.

Measuring the proportion of variance explained (R 2 ) by a statistical model and the relative importance of specific predictors (semi-partial R 2 ) can be essential considerations when building a parsimonious statistical model. The R 2 statistic is a familiar summary of goodness-of-fit for normal linear models and has been extended in various ways to more general models. In particular, the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) extends the normal linear model and is used to analyze correlated (hierarchical), non-normal data structures. Although various R 2 statistics have been proposed, there is no consensus in statistical literature for the most sensible definition of R 2 in this context. This research aims to build upon existing knowledge and definitions of R 2 and to concisely define the statistic for the GLMM. Here, we derive a model and semi-partial R 2 statistic for fixed (population) effects in the GLMM by utilizing the penalized quasi-likelihood estimation method based on linearization. We show that our proposed R 2 statistic generalizes the widely used marginal R 2 statistic introduced by Nakagawa and Schielzeth, demonstrate our statistics capability in model selection, show the utility of semi-partial R 2 statistics in longitudinal data analysis, and provide software that computes the proposed R 2 statistic along with semi-partial R 2 for individual fixed effects. The software provided is adapted for both SAS and R programming languages.",,"",,,"Jaeger BC, Edwards LJ, Das K, Sen PK",,"",,"10.1080/02664763.2016.1193725",,"","1360-0532",,"",,,,"0266-4763","6","Journal of Applied Statistics","",,,,,,,,,"1086","1105",,,"2017-04-26","Published",,,,,,,,,"An R <sup>2</sup> statistic for fixed effects in the generalized linear mixed model","Journal Article","44",,"46","Journal of Applied Statistics (0266-4763)","B","JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS (0266-4763)","0.6640","Journal of Applied Statistics (1360-0532)","0.402","Journal of Applied Statistics (0266-4763)","0.747","No",,"green","12/01/2018 21:19:18","2-s2.0-84973661058","Scopus","Journal of Applied Statistics","SHERPA/RoMEO"

Further studies to characterize variations in symptom patterns over time may provide insights into strategies for more effective management of sickle pain.",,"Department of Pediatrics, Emory Children's Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.",,,"Dampier C, Jaeger B, Gross HE, Barry V, Edwards L, Lui Y, DeWalt DA, Reeve BB",,"",,"10.1002/pbc.25931",,"","1545-5017",,"pubmed:26853841, pmc:PMC5055833",,,"No","1545-5009","6","Pediatric blood & cancer","Humans, Pain, Anemia, Sickle Cell, Hospitalization, Health Status, Quality of Life, Adolescent, Child, Female, Male, Self Report, Patient Outcome Assessment, Surveys and Questionnaires","eng",,"Print-Electronic",,,,,,"1038","1045",,,"2016-06","Published",,,,,"2016-02-09",,,,"Responsiveness of PROMIS® Pediatric Measures to Hospitalizations for Sickle Pain and Subsequent Recovery.","research-article, Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","63",,"13","Pediatric Blood and Cancer (0098-1532)","C","PEDIATRIC BLOOD & CANCER (1545-5009)","2.5130","Pediatric Blood and Cancer (1545-5017)","1.426","Pediatric Blood and Cancer (1545-5009)","1.058","No",,"yellow","26/04/2018 05:12:27","MED:26853841","Europe PubMed Central","Medical and Pediatric Oncology","SHERPA/RoMEO"
